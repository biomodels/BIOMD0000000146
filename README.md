# Model Notes


Figure4 and Figure5 can be simulated by Copasi. Figure4 can be simulated in
MathSBML as well. There are some typos in the paper:K29=234, is it should
k_29; Table2, reaction17, is there are "slash" missing in between the rate
equation; reaction 33,"Akt-PI-PP" in the last term of denominator instead of
"AktPI-P" . For plotting figure4, we create another extra parameter *_percent,
and use assignment rule calculate percentage of each species.
